# Chest X-Ray Diagnosis Webapp
## Summary

This project aims to apply a Machine-Learning (ML) model to detect COVID-19 within patient chest X-ray images. Users will be able to upload, store, and choose which images get analyzed using our trained model. The prototype web interface is designed to be a simple tool which provides diagnostic information. The layout will have few elements including an image upload area and diagnosis display section. Our ML model will specifically detect COVID-19 but, given the opportunity to expand, we will do so with ChestX-ray8 dataset, a much larger dataset.
